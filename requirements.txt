Lab 2.
Write a Map/Reduce program that finds the total number of sales for each day. Write a Java program that doesnâ€™t use Hadoop and finds the same result. Please use appropriate structures (e.g., HashSet, HashMap) to make the Java program as efficient as possible. Make sure you get the same result from both programs. In the Java program, the result should be sorted by date. Also, compare the performance of the two programs. For a fair comparison, make the Java program writes the result to a file.
As a second part of this lab, add a Combiner class to your Map/Reduce solution and see if this improves the speed of your program
